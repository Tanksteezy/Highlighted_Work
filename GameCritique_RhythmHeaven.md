<h2> Rhythm Heaven! </h2>

  <p> Rhythm Heaven is a Nintendo/TNX DS game that anyone can play; even Beyonce, (she was in the advertisement)! 
  There are so many likeable aspects of the game, it is almost hard not to hate it. However, the game does have it's challenges 
  and it is a single-player game, which can be very obvoius to the tester; let us get into that.
   
   The game is a single player game, which is the first thing any tester would notice; any game would usually tell you in the start menu.
   Another obvious function would be how the screen is automatically turned for you to give the longer flicks when playing to the rhythm;
   its a change of perspective for the DS. One of the important functions that should also be looked at is the challenges that are brought 
   to attention when progressing through the levels.
