<h2> Rhythm Heaven! </h2>

  <p> Rhythm Heaven is a Nintendo/TNX DS game that anyone can play; even Beyonce, (she was in the advertisement)! 
  There are so many likeable aspects of the game, it is almost hard not to hate it. However, the game does have it's challenges, which can    be very obvious to a tester, along with the other different approaches this game has made; let us get into that.
   
   The first function I notice was that the game is a single player game, which is the first thing any tester would notice; any game would    usually tell you in the start menu. Another obvious function would be how the screen is automatically turned for you to give the longer     flicks when playing to the rhythm; its a change of perspective for the DS. One of the important functions that should also be looked      at is the challenges that are brought to attention when progressing through the levels; the game increasingly gets harder by having the   rhythm go faster and having a mash-up of ever level as a 'boss fight'.
