<h2> Rhythm Heaven! </h2>

  <p> Rhythm Heaven is a Nintendo/TNX DS game that anyone can play; even Beyonce, (she was in the advertisement)! 
  There are so many likeable aspects of the game, it is almost hard not to hate it. However, the game does have it's challenges, which can    be very obvious to a tester, along with the other different approaches this game has made; let us get into that.
   
   The first function I notice was that the game is a single player game, which is the first thing any tester would notice; any game would    usually tell you in the start menu. Another obvious function would be how the screen is automatically turned for you to give the longer    flicks when playing to the rhythm; its a change of perspective for the DS. One of the important functions that should also be looked      at is the challenges that are brought to attention when progressing through the levels; the game increasingly gets harder by having the    rhythm go faster and having a mash-up of every level as a 'boss fight'; difficulty matters to the tester because that will determine      how much time the tester is willing to spend on the game. However, you are taught different techiques, rhythm, and speed from these new    levels. Also, before the player goes into a new level, there is a small tutorial in the beginning that testers can play or skip.          In the end, I continued to play because it was still fun; despite the fact that i came across some challenges. Therefore, the game ends    up being balanced and usable.</p>
