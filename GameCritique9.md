# Synopsis
Plants VS Zombies on mobile is a single-player strategy game. The player is needed to defend their
home from zombies with different kinds of plants. As the player progresses through each level, the enemies become more challening.


# Game Play Summary
## Playability
The flow is nice as well as the balance and usability. I enjoy the amount of challenges the game throws at the player
because no matter how difficult the enemies become, the game stays balanced; which can also motivate the player and make them feel 
smart when accomplishing the challenge. 

### Single/Multiplayer
Single-player 
### Controls 
* Usage of plants - drag and drop with finger
* Pause/Exit - Pressing upper right hand button with finger 
* Dig up plants - pressing shovel botton on the top left with finger

# Bugs
I have no bugs now but when I had first played it, the game would crash sometimes at random moments. Also, this only happened to me once
, but apparetnly it has happended to others too; if a Pole Vaulting Zombie jumps over a plant with a Tall-nut behind it, 
it will crash into the Tall-nut and start eating it, despite the Tall-nut being behind the zombie. This occurs mostly when there is 
a ladder on the Tall-nut, the Pole Vaulting Zombie will climb over the ladder, try to jump over the next plant, but crash into the 
Tall-nut and have to go over the ladder again.

# Final Thoughts
Plants VS Zombies is a well balance game that increasingly challenges the player, which encourages them to want to keep playing.
