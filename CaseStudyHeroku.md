<h1> Heroku </h1>

  *Things to think about:*
  
  <h3> Development </h3>

  <h3> QA </h3>

  <h3> Pre-Production/Staging/Pilot </h3>

  <h3> Production </h3>
    
  *How does Heroku benifit these testing enviroments above? ^^^ Also, how would you use it for your next "online game project"?*
  
  <p1>Referencing from the website; You are able to add these test environment 'definitions', onto the files, as well as adding scripts IF they are needed. Then, in the end, you are able to see it in the Pipline; the CI is already implemented into the Heroku Pipline so no worries about not involving that. We can apply our testing environments when working with Heroku by accesing the 'Rails Environment'. Most of our testing envoroments will be located in there. Rails allows us to write custom logic, which can be great for code. Not only are we recommended to keep our pre-production close to our production environment, but Heroku also reccommends that we keep our Development close to production and production close to staging. </p1>
