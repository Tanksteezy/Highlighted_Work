## Test Plan:


### Fireball

## 1. Genreal Information
  # Summary
  
   <p1>Fireball is a budget game for PS2. The player controls a ball of fire, and traverses a landscape
  made of blocks of different materials. As the player sets fire to these blocks, they grow hotter, and
  can set fire to more and more different types of blocks. The fireball the player controls can also
  rise up in height and the hotter the player gets, the higher they can jump in this fashion.
  On each field (level) the player has an ultimate goal of igniting the torch (brazier) and thus
  clearing the field â€“ but the torch is generally positioned at a high point and out of reach. The
  player must use a combination of platform skills and dynamic environmental features (for
  instance, by burning the supports under the torch down to the ground) in order to clear the field.
  Simple, clean cut graphics and controls combine to give an easy to learn but engaging play
  experience.
  
   Functions that need to be tested are the single-player, the challenges, techniques, interface, and the levels.</p1>
