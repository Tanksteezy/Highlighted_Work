# Synopsis
Cooking Mama is a Nintendo DS game that allows the player to challenge themselves with different cooking/baking techniques based on the characters/friends besides Mama. 

# Game Play Summary
## Playability
Cooking Mama was not only appealing to the eye but also very fun to play. When starting the game, I was a bit confused on where to start off. However, I did learn what was what after time. 
### Single/Multiplayer
Can play single and multie player!
### Controls
Flick and click of a stylist (any type of movement with the stylists)
# Bugs
There were no bugs when I had played it, however, there were people who claimed to have had bugs by seeing glitchy lines on the bottom half of the Nintendo DS  when the game first came out. Also, when i attempted to play Cooking Mama 2 on a 3DS, (newer platform then), the game would have trouble loading sometimes, so I had to eject it and put it back in until the 3DS read the game.
# Final Thoughts
This game is trully meant for everyone. There are no skills required, but methods the player has to remeber. Although, the game still challenges the player by not only having a good memory, but being timed as well along with recieving a reward if the player achieves their goal.
