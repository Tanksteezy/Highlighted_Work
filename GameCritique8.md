# Bugs
I notice some players flying out of the map as one of the airborne characters; making themselves invisible but can still kill enemies.
Sometimes an object from the map will get stuck by my characters feet.
# Final Thoughts
Overwatch is a world wide game that has attracted so much attention, that everyone knows of the game or has played it;
it is an appealing game with loveable characters. The gameplay is addtictive yet frustrating. However, it never makes
the player stop playing. The game requires the users to work as a team which can go well sometimes, but it can also go bad;
which can make the player learn from some mistakes.
