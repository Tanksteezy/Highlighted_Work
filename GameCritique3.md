# Bugs
At times, my player would get stuck for a second when I would interact with AI using monolouge and a short animation. 
Also, when I was fighting two difficult enemies, one had got stuck onto an object, making it easier for me to kill him. 
# Final Thoughts
RE7 had a great flow even though there were many objectives to follow; very easy to understand and easliy addictive. The Resident Evil franchise had dulled down for me until I played this game. This game has it's own defenition of horror by bringing back some concepts that were in the first couple of Resident Evil's. However, even though Capcom created a nostalgic feel, Capcom did end up making RE7 different from any other franchise, which was risky but it worked. RE7 is fun especially for horror fanatics and would highly recommend it to anyone.
