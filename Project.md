## Thoughts
  <p> So far the game is descent. It is like mineraft which i like, however, it is too slow.
 Minecarft is slow as well but enventually has a pickup. This game, you spawn on one piece of land with minimal resources
 I have to wait instead of exploring on my own. 
 Game is a bit laggy for me
 The controls could use some adjustments. ESP, 1-9, no pause/exit, no control mennu</p>
