# Bugs
I notice that my game would crash randomly at times, but I could never figure out why.
# Final Thoughts
I really think Marmalade Game Studio & Hasbro improved their game by making it more convienient.
For example, whenever I want to play The Game Of Life, no one ever wants to play with me or they would only if it was't too long.
Well, now I can play with Ai or online versus other players! Also, I can speed up the Ai's turn so that I won't get bored.
