# Synopsis
Phase 10 is a randomized card game played with a group of people that need to complete the 10 different phases. 
Whoever completes it first, wins.

# Game Play Summary
## Playability
The game is playable for certain people. Most people would not like the one aspect of the game 
which is educational, however it is just like another card game; just a little more complex then that. 
### Single/Multiplayer
 Multiplayer 
### Controls
 Keep the cards to yourself 
# Bugs
<p> The rules could be a little more specific. For example, when a phase is completed by one person, 
  does the game automatically end after, or that is depending on the next turn wheather they have a completed
  phase as well or not? Phase 10 does include specific rules, but that is one i was always curious about.
# Final Thoughts
The game is appealing to party groups. Great for family and friends; especially those who are competitive. There is math involved, therefore, there is a bit of education in the game, which can turn some heads away. Although, once the player wraps their head around the game, it becomes fun and they want to win.
