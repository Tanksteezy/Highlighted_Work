# Bugs
<p> The rules could be a little more specific. The rules are the phases that are needed to complete the game
however, the rules need to be more in depth.
For example, when a phase is completed by one person, does the game automatically end after, or that is depending on the next turn wheather 
or not the next player has completed a phase as well?</p>
# Final Thoughts
<p> The game is appealing to party groups.
Great for family and friends; especially those who are competitive. There is math involved, 
therefore, there is a bit of learing in the game. </p>
